Tiny bits of one-off code that aren't big enough to fit elsewhere.

## Utilities

* `phpbb_thread_exporter` - Helps you export a phpBB thread's text and images as a single HTML page so it can be archived or turned into a PDF.

## Hardware

* [Google AIY Voice Kit White Nosie Machine](aiy_white_noise_machine/)

## Proof of Concepts

* `privacy_preserving_obdii_processor` - An application does real-time processing to look for unsafe driving and records those
    events rather than full trip data which can expose trip destinations with a high degree
    of accuracy when overlaid on a road map.
