## Utilities

## Hardware

* [Google AIY Voice Kit White Nosie Machine](aiy_white_noise_machine/)
* [Poor Man's ATX Benchtop Power Supply](poor_mans_atx_benchtop_power_supply) Eagle files for a board that breaks out power from an ATX PSU.

## 3D Models

* [Tandy 102 Battery Door](tandy_102_battery_door/)

## Proof of Concepts

* `privacy_preserving_obdii_processor` - An application does real-time processing to look for unsafe driving and records those
    events rather than full trip data which can expose trip destinations with a high degree
    of accuracy when overlaid on a road map.

## Art

* [Lawson 2048](lawson2048/) - A communal game of 2048 that used OpenCV to let players in a building lobby choose the next move by moving around.
