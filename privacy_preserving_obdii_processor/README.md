# Privacy Preserving OBDII Processor

An Arduino application that records driving metrics from an OBDII device.

The application does real-time processing to look for unsafe driving and records those
events rather than full trip data which can expose trip destinations with a high degree
of accuracy when overlaid on a road map.
