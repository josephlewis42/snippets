# Tandy 102 Battery Door

Sketchup models for the battery door for the [Tandy 102 personal computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRS-80_Model_100).
These are often missing on units found on eBay/Craigslist.

There are a few variations here for duarability and cost. Modern 3D printers should have no trouble, but
when I created this most folks had homemade RepRaps which weren't the most relable.
